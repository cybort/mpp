.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The mini preprocessor, \fBmpp\fR, is a \fImacro\fR processor, used to transform source files\. It is offered as an alternative to cpp(1), which is designed with C\-style languages in mind, and often chokes on input from different languages\.
.
.P
The only macros understood by the preprocessor are, at the moment, \fB#include\fR and \fB#define\fR\. See \fIMACROS\fR for more information\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBmpp\fR expects any number of file names as arguments\. The preprocessor reads each file in order, together with any files specified in them through an \fB#include\fR macro\. All the output generated by the combined input files is written to standard output\.
.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-include\fR [\fB<dir>\fR]
Specifies a directory to search for files when resolving an \fB#include\fR, besides the current directory\. Passing this option multiple times results in multiple directories added to the search path\.
.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-define\fR [\fB<name>\fR=\fB<value>\fR]
Defines a replacement before processing the files\. This will be substituted everywhere in the processed files\. Passing this option multiple times results in multiple replacements being defined\.
.
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-make\fR
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule suitable for make(1) describing the dependencies of the involved source files\.
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Show the current version\.
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show the abbreviated command help\.
.
.SH "MACROS"
There are two macros recognized by \fBmpp\fR: \fB#include\fR allows you to include the contents of a file (after pre\-processing it as well), while \fB#define\fR allows you to specify replacement values for snippets of text\.
.
.P
A macro is only parsed if it\'s the only text in a line\. Neither leading nor trailing spaces should appear around a macro invocation\.
.
.TP
\fB#include "<file>"\fR:
.
.IP
Files will be searched relative to the current directory, or relative to any directory specified by the \fB\-I\fR command line flag (see \fIOPTIONS\fR above)\.
.
.IP
The path is expected to be surrounded by double quotes\.
.
.IP
When a file is found, it is in turn preprocessed, so any \fB#include\fR directives in the included file will be followed as well\.
.
.IP
Files are, however, preprocessed at most once per invocation of \fBmpp\fR\. If a file is included multiple times during the same invocation, only the first time will actually have effect, and the other invocations will be ignored\.
.
.IP
If a file cannot be found, execution will stop and no output will be generated\.
.
.TP
\fB#define <string> <replacement>\fR:
.
.IP
Any subsequent appearances of \fB<string>\fR (in this or other source files), will be replaced by \fB<replacement>\fR\.
.
.IP
\fB<string>\fR cannot have spaces, and \fB<replacement>\fR cannot \fIstart\fR with spaces, but \fItrailing spaces will be considered part of the replacement string\fR\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Process \fBmain\.css\fR (and any included file relative to \fBassets/css\fR or the current directory), and put the output in \fBpublic/css/main\.css\fR:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

mpp \-Iassets/css assets/css/main\.css > public/css/main\.css
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0

Process \fBlib\.js\fR, replacing any instance of "$version" with "1\.0\.0":
